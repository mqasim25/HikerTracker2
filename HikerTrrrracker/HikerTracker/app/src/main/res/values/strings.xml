    <string name="dummydata">This app was created with only one goal in mind, keeping track where people are. Whether it\'s a loved one on the other side of the globe or an adolescent out on his own during a hike. Sometimes you just want to know where they are.

        \n\nNo unnecessary fuss, just a location, time and name, collected in an online database.
